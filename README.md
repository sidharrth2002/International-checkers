# international-checkers
An international checkers game built on C++, based on the rules, including crowning, multiple moves in the same turn and score calculation. Made for my first year C++ assignment. Incorporated error handling and next-step prediction algorithms, working with two-dimensional array data structures. 

To compile, fork repository or clone and compile on command line:

//g++ main.cpp
